CAD Simplifier
==============

**CAD Simplifier** is a cross-platform Python application that simplifies CAD files by converting `.stl` models into `.fbx` files with reduced polygon count.

This tool uses advanced mesh processing techniques to create optimized versions of 3D CAD models, making them more efficient for use in real-time applications such as games or augmented reality.

Features
--------

- Converts `.stl` files to `.fbx`
- Reduces polygon count for improved performance
- Uses **CGAL's Alpha Wrapping algorithm** to generate cleaner and more uniform topology `CGAL Alpha Wrapping`_
   - Uses two paramters:
      - Alpha: Determines with facets are included in the wrap (includes facets with larger circumradius than alpha)
      - Offset: The distance of the new facets from the original mesh

- Automates **mesh decimation** using **Blender** `Python API`_
- Saves the output to the `exported` folder after each wrapping and decimation step
- Easy-to-use interface

Software Requirements
--------
To run this application, you must have the following software installed. The app automatically searches for these in standard installation paths.

+----------------+--------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+ | Software | Supported Versions | Notes | +================+==========================+============================================================+ | Blender | 3.x or 4.x | Required for mesh decimation and FBX/GLB export. | +----------------+--------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+ | FreeCAD | 0.21 or higher | Specifically requires FreeCADCmd (Command Line).| +----------------+--------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+ | Python | 3.8+ | Required for development and running via Briefcase. | +----------------+--------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+

Setting Paths for Blender and FreeCAD
--------
The application logic attempts to locate these tools automatically in the following order:

System PATH: If you can run blender or FreeCADCmd from your terminal, the app will find them.

Standard Directories:

Windows: Searches %ProgramFiles%\Blender Foundation and %ProgramFiles%\FreeCAD 0.21\bin\FreeCADCmd.exe.

macOS: Searches /Applications/Blender.app and /Applications/FreeCAD.app.

Linux: Searches /usr/bin/, /snap/bin/, or /usr/local/bin/.

.. note:: If your software is installed in a custom location, add the directory containing the executable to your system's environment variables (PATH).

How to Setup and Run (Development)
--------
To set up the project on a new computer for development:

Clone the Repository .. code-block:: bash

git clone <your-repository-url> cd simplifyapp

Create a Virtual Environment .. code-block:: bash

Windows
python -m venv venv venv\Scripts\activate

macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv source venv/bin/activate

Install Briefcase .. code-block:: bash

pip install briefcase

Run in Development Mode This command installs the necessary Python dependencies (like Toga) and starts the app: .. code-block:: bash

briefcase dev

Packaging the App
To create a native installer for your operating system:

.. code-block:: bash

briefcase create briefcase build briefcase package
