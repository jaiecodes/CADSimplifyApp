CAD Simplifier
==============

**CAD Simplifier** is a cross-platform Python application that simplifies CAD files by converting `.stl` models into `.fbx` files with reduced polygon count.

This tool uses advanced mesh processing techniques to create optimized versions of 3D CAD models, making them more efficient for use in real-time applications such as games or augmented reality.

Features
--------

- Converts `.stl` files to `.fbx`
- Reduces polygon count for improved performance
- Uses **CGAL's Alpha Wrapping algorithm** to generate cleaner and more uniform topology `CGAL Alpha Wrapping`_
   - Uses two paramters:
      - Alpha: Determines with facets are included in the wrap (includes facets with larger circumradius than alpha)
      - Offset: The distance of the new facets from the original mesh

- Automates **mesh decimation** using **Blender** `Python API`_
- Saves the output to the `exported` folder after each wrapping and decimation step
- Easy-to-use interface
